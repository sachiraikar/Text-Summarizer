#Text Summarization Tool ✂️🧠

This project is a smart text summarization application that uses advanced natural language processing techniques to condense long documents into concise summaries. It helps users quickly grasp the key points of any lengthy text, saving time and improving comprehension.

🔍 Key Features:

Summarizes long text inputs using the LexRank algorithm for extractive summarization

Clean and interactive web UI for easy text input and summary display

Built with Python and Flask for quick deployment and lightweight backend

Stylish and responsive frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Supports UTF-8 encoded text and multiple sentences summary output

⚙️ How It Works:

User inputs or uploads a long text document via the web interface

Text is processed by the Sumy library’s LexRank summarizer

A summary of specified sentence length is generated

The summary is displayed instantly on the UI

🚀 Technologies Used:

Python (Flask) for backend server and routing

Sumy library with LexRank algorithm for text summarization

NLTK for natural language tokenization

HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend and styling

🎯 Use Cases:

Quick summarization of articles, reports, or research papers
